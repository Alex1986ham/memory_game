# memory_game
Memory Game of 4x4 matrix of cards

The target of this memory game is to find two cards which display the same letter. 
So to win, you needed to remember the position of tiles.

Dependencies:

The game consists of 16 cards with letters on one side and a background-image which is the same on all cards. 
Each letter appears on precisely two cards.
When the game starts, all tiles are turned face down. The player then flips over two cards, selecting them by clicking on them. 
If the two cards have the same letter, they remain face up. Otherwise, the cards flip back over after a small period of time.
The goal of the game is to get all the cards flipped face up in the least number of tries. 
The player's performance is measured in terms of time and moves displayed in stars. 

Resources used:

The game consists of four files:
index. html
app. css
app. js
chinese.png

Additional add-ons are also added:
jQuery
Sweetalerts

What can be done to make the game better:

- Instead of using two cards of the same type, you could build in 3 or more cards of the same type and thus will extend the entire game matrix.
- You could add a rotation effect for turning the cards.
- The background of the game could be improved with the help of other CSS-style elements.
- You could use symbols instead of letters.
