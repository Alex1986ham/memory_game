Memory Game of 4x4 matrix of cards

The target of this memory game is to find two cards which display the same letter. 
So to win, you needed to remember the position of tiles.
The game consists of 16 cards with letters on one side and a background-image which is the same on all cards. 
Each letter appears on precisely two cards.
When the game starts, all tiles are turned face down. The player then flips over two cards, selecting them by clicking on them. 
If the two cards have the same letter, they remain face up. Otherwise, the cards flip back over after a small period of time.
The goal of the game is to get all the cards flipped face up in the least number of tries.
